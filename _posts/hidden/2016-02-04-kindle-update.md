[Looks like a solid improvement to the Amazon Kindle](http://smile.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=13550053011&ref_=pe_2405760_166011780_deveng_ku16), particularly when it comes to navigating the UI via touch. However, the increased focus on social media and "Sharing Made Easy" is concerning. My Kindle is one of few devices where I can consume media without distraction. In this regard, I'm OK with new social channels through which to send content, but if the Kindle ever starts _receiving_ notifications, I'll be in a personal hell.
