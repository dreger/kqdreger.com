There's [a new research study][study] out called "Are two spaces bet­ter than one? The ef­fect of spac­ing fol­low­ing pe­ri­ods and com­mas dur­ing read­ing" by Re­becca John­son, Becky Bui, and Lind­say Schmitt. The research concluded that using two spaces after a period or comma leads to an improvement in reading speed.

> True, the re­searchers found that putting two spaces af­ter a pe­riod de­liv­ered a “small” but “sta­tis­ti­cally … de­tectable” im­prove­ment in read­ing speed—about 3%—but cu­ri­ously, only for those read­ers who *al­ready type* with two spaces. For ha­bit­ual one-spac­ers, there was no ben­e­fit at all.

> Fur­ther­more, the re­searchers only tested sam­ples of a [**mono­spaced font**](https://practicaltypography.com/monospaced-fonts.html) on screen (roughly as shown be­low). They didn’t test pro­por­tional fonts, which they ac­knowl­edge are far more com­mon. Nor did they test the ef­fect of two-spac­ing on the printed page. The au­thors con­cede that any of these test-de­sign choices could’ve af­fected their findings.

> In sum—a small dif­fer­ence, lim­ited to a cer­tain cat­e­gory of test sub­jects, with nu­mer­ous caveats at­tached. Not much to see here, I’m afraid.
