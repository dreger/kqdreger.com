Derek Sivers on why he's quitting Facebook (emphasis his): 

> Maybe the fact that I use it to share my blog posts is a tiny tiny reason why others are still using it. **It’s like I’m still visiting friends in the smoking area, even though I don’t smoke.** Maybe if I quit going entirely, it will help my friends quit, too. [...]

> I’ve been online since 1994. I remember when everyone thought mp3.com was everything, and a few years later it was gone. Then everyone thought MySpace was everything, and a few years later it was moot. Now it’s Facebook, Instagram, and Google, but eventually they’ll all be moot, too. It’s the natural cycle of things.
