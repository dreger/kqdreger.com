title: Facebook Reminder Helps Drive Increased Voter Registration
---

Niraj Chokshi, writing for the New York Times: 

> At least nine secretaries of state have credited the social network’s voter registration reminder, displayed for four days in September, with boosting sign-ups, in some cases by considerable amounts. Data from nine other states show that registrations rose drastically on the first day of the campaign compared with the day before.

Not that today needed a balance to the previous link, which criticized Facebook's innability to weed out fake stories from treanding news. 

David Talbot, writing for the [MIT Technology Review][mit]: 

> Starting in 2008, Facebook started nudging people to vote by posting special reminders that say: “Today is Election Day.” These messages include a button that Facebook members can click to indicate they have voted—information that is in turn shared automatically with their friends.

> New research suggests these messages have striking real-world power. On Election Day 2010, these reminders, when adorned with faces of those who’d clicked “I voted,” drove an additional 340,000 voters to polls nationwide, according to research conducted by Facebook and academics, and published today in Nature.

Later, in Mr. Talbot's piece: 

> Was the increased voting enough to throw someone out of office? Facebook’s voting messages are nonpartisan, and the authors says the increased voting effect was the same on a subset of self-reported conservatives as on self-reported liberals. But one day Facebook’s get-out-the-vote efforts could have a bigger effect. Nationally there are far more registered Democrats than Republicans—72 million to 55 million. (Another 42 million are registered as Independent.)  “Increased voter turnout is generally associated with favoring Democrats,” Schlough notes. And slim margins can have big consequences.
