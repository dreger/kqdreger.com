title: Facebook Fails Sorting Fiction From Fact
---

Following up [Part 1][wapo1], Caitlin Dewey, the Washington Post: 

> As part of a larger audit of Facebook’s Trending topics, the Intersect logged every news story that trended across four accounts during the workdays from Aug. 31 to Sept. 22. During that time, we uncovered five trending stories that were indisputably fake and three that were profoundly inaccurate. On top of that, we found that news releases, blog posts from sites such as Medium and links to online stores such as iTunes regularly trended. Facebook declined to comment about Trending on the record.

> “On re-review,” the statement said, “the topic was deemed as inaccurate.”

> Although these review guidelines appear largely to blame, Facebook hasn’t indicated any plans to change them. Rather, the social network maintains that its fake news problem can be solved by better and more robust algorithms.

> It’s worth noting, of course, that even Google News has been fooled before — all social platforms, not just Facebook, struggle with the complex and overwhelming task of identifying hoaxes and other sorts of misinformation. Still, Facebook is a special case: About 40 percent of all American adults turn to it for news, which — despite chief executive Mark Zuckerberg’s insistence that Facebook is “not a media company” — makes its handling of things like Trending really important.

[Report by Gizmodo][giz] that accused Facebook of routinely suppressing conservative news.
