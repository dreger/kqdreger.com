title: Automation by Limitation
---

David Smith on Apple's new App Store review guidelines: 

> Starting tomorrow Apple will start enforcing a new rule limiting the length of an app’s name to 50 characters. Additionally, they will start [disallowing apps][app store] from including “terms or descriptions that are not the name of the app”.

As a fan of terse editing and reduced spam in the App Store, this will be a welcomed change. The old policy wasn't working, and a cursory look at App Store search results proved that.

However, as pointed out by , "terms or descriptions that are not the name of the app" have always been prohibited: 

> This has always been in the guidelines, but appears to be rarely enforced. For proof, just search for a popular app in the Store: Instagram, Tweetbot, and NYTimes will all work. Then, just scroll right to the bottom and find yourself wading through the App Store equivalent of a backalley flea market.

 So why reduce it at all? 

However, by reducing the character allowance to 50, which is plenty generous, Apple can help automate part of the curation process.
