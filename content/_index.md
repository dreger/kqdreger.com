# ✌️ Welcome to my website.

Hey, I'm K.Q. Dreger. By day I work at [Patriot](https://patriotsoftware.com/), where I get to empower our product and design teams as the director of product. By night I [write](/notes.html) about products, people, and punctuation. And by nighter night I bake. Bread, mostly. 

[Check out some of my essays](/notes.html).
