  	<p>These are the questions our designers ask one another before any user-facing design goes live. Think of this as a checklist, like the ones they use at <strong>NASA</strong> before a takeoff. It&rsquo;s a simple tool that helps ensure all designs meet the same requirements, and it&rsquo;s easily understood by new and seasoned designers.</p>
<h2 id="checklist">Checklist</h2>
<p><strong>Why are you building this?</strong> What&rsquo;s the value for the customer? How does this benefit our company? Have we tried this before? What do things look like a year after shipping? Be a reporter: dig for context, ask a lot of questions, see the whole board.</p>
<p><strong>Have you asked for feedback?</strong> Show work early and often. Have another teammate look at your design. Reviews and critiques generate an abundance of feedback, but there&rsquo;s always something you might not have noticed or considered. Everyone has to invite feedback, but we trust you to make the final decision.</p>
<p><strong>Is your design accessible?</strong> Can someone navigate the interface with only a keyboard? How&rsquo;s the contrast between text and background colors? <a href="http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/23/the-veil-of-ignorance/">Not everyone</a> has a Retina display or 20/20 vision. Think text size, colors, layout, and metadata, as outlined by the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines">WCAG</a></strong>. Read our internal accessibility guide, and address all critical-level concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Has anyone tried using this thing?</strong> Watch someone use your design. Document or record what they do. This doesn&rsquo;t need to be formal usability test — in-house folks are users too — but try to have someone who&rsquo;s not a designer use what you&rsquo;ve made.</p>
<p><strong>How will you know it worked?</strong> What data needs tracked in order to validate your design? How do you define and measure success? Try to come up with a few concrete, specific metrics — qualitative or quantitive — that you can use to inform future changes.</p>
