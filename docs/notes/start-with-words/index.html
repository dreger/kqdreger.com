  	<p>I start most of my interface designs in <a href="https://dreger.me/notes/textedit/">TextEdit</a>. Why? Because it forces me to focus on the words. Words are like stock in a delicious stew. If you don&rsquo;t have good stock, the whole meal feels off.</p>
<p>TextEdit-the-design-tool is surprisingly robust. Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>Say we&rsquo;ve got to design a rather standard looking confirmation modal with two options for the user. Open TextEdit and start writing:</p>
<pre><code>Are you sure you want to cancel?
----------

Your account will remain active until 2/1/2018.

- If you resubscribe by 3/10/2018 you will retain your data.
- If you resubscribe after 3/10/2018 you'll have create a new account.
- You may download your data until 3/10/2018.

[ No ] [ Yes ] 
</code></pre><p>You can almost <em>see</em> the modal, can&rsquo;t you? You can tell that &ldquo;Are you sure you want to cancel?&rdquo; is some sort of header. You also know that <code>[ No ]</code> and <code>[ Yes ]</code> are buttons. If you&rsquo;re feeling fancy, you can even bump up the border radius:</p>
<pre><code>( No ) ( Yes )
</code></pre><p>Joking.</p>
<p>Now here&rsquo;s where the real magic happens — the editing. Before opening Sketch or a new HTML document, continue to iterate on the language. Sometimes it helps to pretend like I have to actually speak these words to someone who&rsquo;s sitting right in front of me. How would I write this for another human to read?</p>
<pre><code>Are you sure you want to cancel?

Your account will remain active until 2/1/2018.

Come back anytime before 3/15/2018 to reactivate your account or request a copy of your data. After 3/15, your account and data will be permanently deleted.

[ Nevermind ] [ Cancel my account ]
</code></pre><p>Better. Fewer bullets, more readable.</p>
<p>Constraints help create better designs. TextEdit forces me to focus on the smallest (yet arguably most important) part of any design: the words. Because there&rsquo;s no functional UI yet, my copy can&rsquo;t hide behind appealing aesthetic, and I&rsquo;m less prone to overwriting.</p>
<p>TextEdit (plain text mode, or <code>CMD + Shift + T</code>) is what I use, but pen and paper, Google Docs, or — yes — Sketch work equally as well. Whatever you use, start with words, and then build your design from there.</p>
