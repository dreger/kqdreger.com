  	<p>Yesterday, the United States Men&rsquo;s National Team—with a 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago—failed to qualify for next year&rsquo;s World Cup. The last time this happened was 1986.</p>
<p>A lot of things went wrong to get us here, but I&rsquo;m still upset. A few brief, emotional, and irrational thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing the World Cup will take a lot of wind out of the sails for United States soccer. It really felt like we were building up some good momentum, too.</li>
<li>Unlike other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series">World * events</a>, the World Cup is actually a worldwide competition, which makes it objectively<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> cooler.</li>
<li>The World Cup is only held every four years, which means I still have the rest of 2017 to finish before the four-year-countdown can start.</li>
<li>Does this mean no new jerseys? If there&rsquo;s one thing a World Cup could guarantee, it&rsquo;s that some designer at Nike would tweak a gradient on the old kits, and we&rsquo;d be happy to pay for it.</li>
<li>Who do I root for now?</li>
