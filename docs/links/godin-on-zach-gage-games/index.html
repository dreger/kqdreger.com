  	<p>Derek Godin, writing about iOS developer/designer Zach Gage and his newest game, <em>Pocket-Run Pool</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gage specializes in taking well-worn casual game mainstays (word puzzles, chess, solitaire) and twisting them in small, clever ways. Often these are simple mechanical tweaks; <em>Really Bad Chess</em> gives players one king and 15 other random pieces to duke it out with, while <em>Sage Solitaire</em> elegantly splits the difference between classic Klondike and poker. His latest game <a href="http://www.pocketrunpool.com/"><em>Pocket-Run Pool</em></a> is his version of an arcade-style billiards game, with rotating pocket multipliers and three lives (i.e. scratches) to clear the table.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Zach Gage remix is the best kind of remix. <em>Pocket-Run Pool</em> is certainly enjoyable, but <a href="http://reallybadchess.com"><em>Really Bad Chess</em></a> remains one of my favorite games on iOS.</p>
