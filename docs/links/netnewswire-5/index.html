  	<p>If I could only teach my non-technical friends two things about technology, I would encourage them to (a) learn the keyboard shortcuts for their most-used apps and (b) use RSS to read the news.</p>
<p>Speaking of RSS, Brent Simmons has finally finished rewriting NetNewsWire—the storied RSS reader for the Mac. You can pick it up for free, and even if you&rsquo;re not sure what RSS is, check out the link because, again, it&rsquo;s one of only two things I wish more people knew about.</p>
<p>NetNewsWire only supports syncing via Feedbin at the moment (Feedly support is being considered), but you can also use it as a standalone RSS reader—no account required. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing, and it works great. An iOS app is forthcoming, which I&rsquo;m  excited about because for as terrible as desktop web news reading is, it&rsquo;s 10x worse on mobile.</p>
<p>I like to measure products against the yardstick of what they set out to do. For me, NetNewsWire scores high on all marks. It&rsquo;s fast, stable, and ultimately provides a small counterargument to the notion that we <em>have</em> to put up with website bloat, ad trackers, and algorithmically-powered social nonsense just to read the news.</p>
