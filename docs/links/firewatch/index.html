  	<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to this game for two years, and it&rsquo;s almost here. I&rsquo;ll be covering the reviews that get released today, but I&rsquo;ll omit anything from <em>my commentary or the pull-quotes</em> that might spoil unreleased details about the game.</p>
<p>For the unaware, <em>Firewatch</em> is the first game from <a href="https://panic.com/">Panic</a>-backed game studio, <a href="http://www.camposanto.com/">Campo Santo</a>. Aside from the art style, which looks incredible, I&rsquo;m most excited to work my way through the story. From the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/383870">Steam game page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The year is 1989. You are a man named Henry who has retreated from his messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched high atop a mountain, it’s your job to look for smoke and keep the wilderness safe. An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor Delilah is available to you at all times over a small, handheld radio—your only contact with the world you&rsquo;ve left behind. But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and into the forest, you’ll explore a wild and unknown environment, facing questions and making choices that can build or destroy the only meaningful relationship you have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re curious, I&rsquo;ll be buying my copy for PS4. If you plan on buying the game on Windows, Mac, or Linux, you can still take advantage of a 10% discount by <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/383870">pre-ordering the game on Steam</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Looks like PS4 users can get a 10% discount by purchasing <em>Firewatch</em> on release day. You are officially out of reasons to not buy this game.</p>
