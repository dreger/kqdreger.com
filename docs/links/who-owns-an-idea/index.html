<blockquote>
<p>By the 1990s teams of MBAs and business-school scholars joined forces to see if advances in information technology, management techniques, law, and sociology could allow them to extract workers’ know-how so that the company could store and own it indefinitely. The resulting academic research field and management fad became known as “knowledge management.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This article traces changes in US law, business practices, and social expectations about research and invention in order to illuminate the history of business control over scientists’ ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found this a short and fascinating look into the world of academics and scientific research. It got me thinking too, and now I&rsquo;m curious how big tech companies like Google or Apple approach this sort of &ldquo;knowledge management&rdquo;, especially as it relates to academic- and research-driven departments like machine learning or artificial intelligence.</p>
