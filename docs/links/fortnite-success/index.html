    <h2><a href='http://nymag.com/selectall/2018/07/how-fortnite-became-the-most-popular-video-game-on-earth.html'>‘Fortnite’ Is a Runaway Success</a></h2>
    


    

  	<p>Brian Feldman for <em>New York Magazine</em>, in a piece titled, &ldquo;The Most Important Video Game on the Planet&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Analysts estimate that <em>Fortnite</em> is currently raking in more than $300 million a month, and has made its maker, Epic Games, more than $1.2 billion since its battle royale mode launched in late September. That’s all from a game that’s free to download and play unrestricted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To clarify: anything you can buy in <em>Fortnite</em> is purely cosmetic and doesn&rsquo;t give you a better chance at winning. You buy outfits or dance moves to taunt your friends with. We <a href="https://dreger.me/links/activision-matchmaking-and-microtransactions-patent/">know microtransactions are a profitable business plan</a>, but even Epic&rsquo;s success here is somewhat staggering.</p>
<p>The article goes into a few reasons why <em>Fortnite</em> — not the first game to have a battle royale mode — is currently experiencing a moment. A combination of wide availability (it&rsquo;s on almost every game console and smartphone you can think of), cartoon-style graphics, and kid-friendly goofy &ldquo;violence&rdquo; (there&rsquo;s no blood when you eliminate an opponent) leaves you with a game that&rsquo;s literally everywhere and enjoyed by seemingly everyone.</p>
<p>One final bit from Mr. Feldman&rsquo;s piece that caught my eye was this aside about one of <em>Fortnite&rsquo;s</em> most famous players, Tyler &ldquo;Ninja&rdquo; Blevins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ninja, whose real name is Tyler Blevins, makes an estimated half a million dollars every month streaming <em>Fortnite</em> rounds on Twitch, a service for livestreaming video games that is owned by Amazon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know which scenario is more astonishing: Epic making $300 million a month from a free-to-play game, or Ninja collecting $500,000 in the same amount of time for <em>playing</em> said game.</p>
