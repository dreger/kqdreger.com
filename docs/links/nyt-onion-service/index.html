<p>As pointed out by Ms. Sandvik, <em>the Times</em> joins—among others—Facebook and ProPublic, each of which provide their own Onion Services. For background on why this matters, here’s <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/facebook-hidden-services-and-https-certs">this 2014 post</a> from the Tor Project’s blog (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services">Hidden services</a> provide a variety of useful security properties. First - and the one that most people think of - because the design uses <a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview#thesolution">Tor circuits</a>, it&rsquo;s hard to discover where the service is located in the world. But second, because the address of the service is <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/rend-spec.txt#l527">the hash of its key</a>, they are self-authenticating: <em>if you type in a given .onion address, your Tor client guarantees that it really is talking to the service that knows the private key that corresponds to the address.</em> A third nice feature is that the rendezvous process provides end-to-end encryption, even when the application-level traffic is unencrypted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, you can now be reasonably sure that when you access <code>nytimes3xbfgragh.onion</code>, you&rsquo;re getting the real thing. Additionally, having a growing number of real-world publications make their sites available as Onion Services doesn&rsquo;t hurt Tor&rsquo;s credibility.</p>
<p>The nuances of Tor and .onion addresses get a little… nerdy, but here’s the bigger takeaway: although you could always access <code>nytimes.com</code> through a Tor browser (which provided an additional level of anonymity to your browsing), the availability of a fully fledged .onion URL run by <em>the Times</em> speaks to a growing worldwide desire for encrypted and unmonitored use of the Internet, particularly when it comes to accessing the news. I can’t imagine any meaningful percentage of readers will switch to using the new .onion address, but as with most things Tor, if you can (a) already access <em>The New York Times</em> and (b) do so without worry, this service probably isn’t aimed at you.</p>
