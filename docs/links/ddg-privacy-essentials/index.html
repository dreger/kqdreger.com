<p>Today we’re taking a major step to simplify online privacy with the launch of fully revamped versions of our browser extension and mobile app, now with built-in tracker network blocking, smarter encryption, and, of course, private search – all designed to operate seamlessly together while you search and browse the web.</p>

<p>The DuckDuckGo browser extension and mobile app will also now show you a Privacy Grade rating (A-F) when you visit a website. This rating lets you see at a glance how protected you are, dig into the details to see who we caught trying to track you, and learn how we enhanced the underlying website&rsquo;s privacy measures. The Privacy Grade is scored automatically based on the prevalence of hidden tracker networks, encryption availability, and website privacy practices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simple, fast, and powered by a company that <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy">cares about your privacy</a>. On today&rsquo;s web, that&rsquo;s pretty much all you can ask for.</p>
<p>That said, and although the browser extensions work well, the new iOS app is a little rough. I have no doubt it&rsquo;s functional, but there are a few UI oddities that come off as tone deaf to how iOS apps should behave. For example, the app mimics Safari in that when you&rsquo;re scrolling down a webpage, the browser UI recedes so you can see as much page content as possible. However, unlike Safari, when you begin scrolling back <em>up</em> the page, DuckDuckGo&rsquo;s app doesn&rsquo;t immediately unhide the UI. Sometimes it&rsquo;ll take an extra downward thumb flick to get the controls back. Here&rsquo;s where it gets weirder though. Start by scrolling down so the browser UI recedes, scroll up half a screen (in most cases the browser chrome will still be hidden), and <em>then</em> scroll down. Suddenly, the UI controls are back. It&rsquo;s baffling.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Okay, now that I&rsquo;m done beating up their app, let me pitch why you should be using DuckDuckGo as your default search engine. I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">their web search</a> for the past few years (desktop and mobile), and it&rsquo;s great. I rarely, if ever, need to run something through Google, and for times I do, I simply append <code>!g</code> to my query and DuckDuckGo runs the search for me.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> I wholeheartedly recommend you give DuckDuckGo a try if you haven&rsquo;t already. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>DuckDuckGo has a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/bang">whole host of other &ldquo;bangs&rdquo;</a> that work in the same way as <code>!g</code>. Some of my most used are <code>!yt</code> for YouTube, <code>!a</code> for Amazon, and <code>!nyt</code> for when I&rsquo;m trying to find an obscure usage of the <em>New York Times Manual of Style</em>. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
