  	<p><em>The Sweet Setup</em> Staff (via <a href="https://initialcharge.net/2018/08/1password-will/">Michael Rockwell</a>), on using the password manager <a href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> as a digital will:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike a conventional will, this document (or database) is not as much about who gets your stuff, but more about helping your family member unwind the countless online accounts and collections of media and digital property that you have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When my mother passed away a number of years ago, handling all of the online bills, email accounts, and digital subscriptions for my family would have been a nightmare if not for 1Password. After a death, there&rsquo;s enough to worry about in the physical world let alone the digital one that person leaves behind. As the person who handles most of the online bills and subscriptions for my family, the knowledge that my wife has a one stop shop for all of those life details is relieving.</p>
<p>Back to the linked-to piece: 1Password is my go-to recommendation whenever someone asks for a good password manager, but there&rsquo;s so much more it can do. The team at the <em>Sweet Setup</em> have done a great job writing up the 1Password-as-a-will angle, and they&rsquo;ve also just <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/1password/">launched an entirely new 1Password course</a> that goes deep on the many other ways 1Password can bring security and sanity to your digital life. There&rsquo;s a launch price special for $23 (cheap!), and any course purchase gets you an extended 90-day free trial of 1Password itself. It&rsquo;s an excellent deal.</p>
<p>I try not to write in absolutes, but 1Password is one of few (if not the only) service that I&rsquo;ll happily pay for until the day I die. I really don&rsquo;t know how else to put it.</p>
