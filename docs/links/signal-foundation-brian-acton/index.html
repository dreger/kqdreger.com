  	<p>Andy Greenberg, <em>Wired</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the four or so years since it launched, end-to-end encrypted messaging app <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/signal">Signal</a> has become the security community&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ditch-all-those-other-messaging-apps-heres-why-you-should-use-signal/">gold standard</a> for surveillance-resistant communications. Its creators have built an encryption protocol that companies <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/forget-apple-vs-fbi-whatsapp-just-switched-encryption-billion-people/">from WhatsApp</a> to <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/10/facebook-completely-encrypted-messenger-update-now/">Facebook Messenger</a> to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/skype-end-to-end-encryption-voice-text/">Skype</a>have all added to their own products to offer truly private conversations to billions of people. And it&rsquo;s done so as a non-profit with, at any given moment, a tiny staff that includes just two or three full-time coders. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On Wednesday, the creators of Signal announced the launch of the Signal Foundation, which will build and maintain Signal and potentially other privacy-focused apps to come, too. WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has also joined as the foundation&rsquo;s executive chairman, his first new role since leaving WhatsApp last fall. And Acton&rsquo;s not only devoting the next phase of his post-WhatsApp career to Signal, but a fair-sized chunk of his WhatsApp billions, too: He&rsquo;s personally injecting $50 million into the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you follow the information security crowd, you&rsquo;ll quickly pick up on a general cynicism towards technology. Who can blame them? Between the Internet of (unsecured) Things and this quarter&rsquo;s rendition of <em>guess which retailer leaked your credit card</em>, there&rsquo;s plenty of room for criticism.</p>
<p>However, whenever I see Signal come up, it really does seem to live up to that &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; label. It&rsquo;s not perfect, and the app has some problems, but the encryption code is peer reviewed and open source, and it&rsquo;s trusted by some of the biggest public targets in the world. The United States Senate <a href="https://dreger.me/links/senate-approves-signal/">uses it</a>, and, famously, Signal <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/snowden/status/778592275144314884">is Edward Snowden&rsquo;s preferred messaging app</a>.</p>
<p>Sidestepping my own cynicism that comes out whenever &ldquo;loved app X takes large investment from vc/company Y,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s heartening to see the Signal team get a little structure and financial breathing room. I hope the money goes to fund further development and stability of the service, while avoiding the distractions or gimmicky features — like stories — that every messaging app seems to have these days. Signal is not like other messaging apps, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. The world needs an incredibly secure, focused messaging protocol, and Signal&rsquo;s now got the resources to continue building just that.</p>
