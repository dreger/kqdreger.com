  	<p>Nick Stat, <em>The Verge</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google has officially removed the Hangouts brand from its enterprise G Suite offering with the rebranding of Hangouts Chat as Google Chat, the company confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> on Thursday. The rebranding follows a similar name change, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21214059/google-hangouts-meet-rebrand-video-chat-conferencing">confirmed yesterday</a>, from the companion videoconferencing app Hangouts Meet to Google Meet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This latest modification was first hinted at by an <a href="https://support.google.com/a/table/7539891?hl=en">updated G Suite support document</a> listing the Google Chat name alongside Google Meet. Of course, this version of Chat is not to be confused with the <em>other</em> version of Chat, the name Google inexplicably gave its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964477/googles-rcs-chat-android-rollout-us-ccmi-texting-sms">relatively new RCS-based Android messaging protocol</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the Hangouts brand, it will continue to live on as the name of the consumer chat app that Google spun out of its shutdown social network Google+ back in 2013 as a spiritual successor to Gchat. “There will be no changes to the consumer (classic) version of Hangouts,” a Google spokesperson tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who thought changing the <em>recognized</em> name of a product currently experiencing unprecedented demand was a good idea? Not that this will hurt their SEO, mind you.</p>
