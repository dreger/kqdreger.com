  	<p>Just over a year ago, I started working on a small iOS app for writers. I was tired of not having a focused, single-purpose place for drafting and editing important messages, emails, and text. I hated doing those things in Messages or Mail, and I avoided Notes because what I was writing didn&rsquo;t need to be <em>stored</em> anywhere. All I wanted was a tasteful place to write.</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve finished, and next week I&rsquo;m excited to ship <a href="https://audaciousfox.net/projects/edit">Edit for iOS</a>.</p>
<p>Edit has several neat features (dark mode, pinch-to-zoom text size, word and character count), but I think the most interesting one is that Edit doesn&rsquo;t store multiple notes. You get one page, and whatever you leave there will be there when you come back. Because of this, I&rsquo;ve found that Edit <em>complements</em> many of the other great writing and note taking apps out there instead of competing with them. You can quickly drop a thought in Edit, let it sit, come back later, punch it up, and then export what you&rsquo;ve written to anywhere in iOS. Over the past year, I&rsquo;ve used Edit to jot down journal entries, tweak tweets, or as a place of reference for important information I need throughout the day. I use it almost every single day, and I&rsquo;m really happy with how this single page scratchpad fits into my life.</p>
<p>Edit is available as a pre-order on the App Store for $1.99, and it also comes with a 10-year good faith guarantee, which basically means I&rsquo;ll work hard to keep Edit available for your next decade of iOS devices. Cool, no?</p>
<p>(Typography fun: I&rsquo;m using the system standard San Francisco, but I&rsquo;ve enabled a few alternative characters and numbers to give Edit a familiar but unique feel.)</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1231744746">Check out Edit on the App Store</a> or <a href="https://audaciousfox.net/projects/edit">enjoy the micro-marketing page</a> I put together. I hope you like Edit as much as I enjoyed making it.</p>
<p>Happy writing.</p>
