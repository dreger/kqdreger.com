  	<p>From the Medium Help Center:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Medium is no longer offering new custom domains as a feature. If you already have a custom domain on Medium, nothing will change for you for the foreseeable future, and your domain will continue to work as expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As best I can tell, this decision is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180103074558/https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005579728-Custom-domains-on-Medium">change from January</a> (courtesy of the Internet Archive), when the help page for custom domains read that Medium was &ldquo;pausing&rdquo; offering the service. It would now seem they don&rsquo;t offer the setting at all.</p>
<p>I wonder if current custom domain users find the &ldquo;for the foreseeable future&rdquo; bit at all reassuring. I wouldn&rsquo;t. Using your own domain was one of the few meaningful ways you could separate your Medium-hosted blog from all the others. Anyone signing up today will be stuck using whatever publication names (<code>medium.com/publication</code>) are still available to register, making Medium more akin to a long-form Twitter than a place to keep a blog. Lame.</p>
