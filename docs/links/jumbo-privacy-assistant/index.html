  	<p>Pierre Valade (previously CEO of Sunrise Calendar, which was acquired by Microsoft) has launched  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jumbo-privacy/id1454039975">Jumbo</a>, a &ldquo;privacy assistant&rdquo; for iOS. Curious, I thought, because most other digital assistants are hellbent on collecting as much information about me as possible. In reality, Jumbo is less of an assistant and more of a user-friendly way for you to delete old tweets, Alexa voice recordings, and Google searches. One tap and everything gets erased. If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to delete this sort of data by hand (data that Twitter, Amazon, and Google would rather you let them keep) you&rsquo;ll know how wonderfully simple Jumbo&rsquo;s approach is.</p>
<p>My favorite thing about Jumbo is that <a href="https://blog.jumboprivacy.com/secure-jumbo-never-sees-your-data.html">everything&rsquo;s handled locally</a>—none of my data gets stored or manipulated server-side. The compromise is that since Jumbo doesn&rsquo;t store any of my logins or information on their servers, it&rsquo;s on me to open the app every week and initiate a cleaning. A small price to pay.</p>
<p>Jumbo is the rare example of a truly user-focused privacy product. None of your information is slipped out the side door to sell ads, and Mr. Valade is upfront with how they plan to make money: premium features, accessible via subscription. I&rsquo;m not optimistic that Jumbo will be around for the longterm—how many people will pay for something like this?—but for now consider me a fan.</p>
