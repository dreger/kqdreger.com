  	<p>Joseph Berger for the New York Times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elie Wiesel, the Auschwitz survivor who became an eloquent witness for the six million Jews slaughtered in World War II and who, more than anyone else, seared the memory of the Holocaust on the world’s conscience, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. [&hellip;]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“He raised his voice, not just against anti-Semitism, but against hatred, bigotry and intolerance in all its forms,”  [President Obama] said Saturday in a statement. “He implored each of us, as nations and as human beings, to do the same, to see ourselves in each other and to make real that pledge of ‘never again.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Set aside a couple of minutes, find a quiet spot, and read through this whole piece. Among many, many, other things, Mr. Wiesel&rsquo;s life is a testament to the awesome power our words can have.</p>
