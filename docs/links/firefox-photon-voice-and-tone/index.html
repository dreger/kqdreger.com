  	<p>The style guide itself is good, but what drew my attention was the <em>visual</em> representation of tone ranges. Personally, I find the visual a far more clear example of what the Firefox UI copy should read like than a bullet list of examples would have conveyed.

A good reminder that product design writing isn&rsquo;t about how it&rsquo;s written, it&rsquo;s about how it reads.</p>
