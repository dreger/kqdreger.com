  	<p>Advanced Protection works by focusing on, what Google calls, three core defenses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Requiring a physical, USB Security Key to log in to your account.</li>
<li>Only allowing specific apps to access to your Google data. For now, the only apps that can access your data will be Google&rsquo;s own.</li>
<li>Having additional reviews and procedures for any account changes or recovery requests.</li>
</ol>
<p>This program isn&rsquo;t for everyone—Google&rsquo;s clear on that—but for journalists, campaign staffers, or anyone who might be at a higher risk for hacking or phishing, this appears to be an obvious preventive step.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, using a strong, unique password and turning on Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/">Two-Factor Authentication</a> should be good start. It&rsquo;s also worth checking out what apps <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">have access to your account</a>, and then removing the ones you don&rsquo;t use anymore.</p>
