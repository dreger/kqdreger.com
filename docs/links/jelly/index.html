<p>Biz Stone, on the &ldquo;un-pivot&rdquo; relaunch of Jelly, his Q&amp;A social network:</p>

<p>I laughed at the asking-questions-on-social-media-is-awkward bit, because I&rsquo;ll bet you Jelly&rsquo;s iOS app prompts for access to my Twitter accounts or Contacts, so they can find those people who, you know, it was awkward to ask things before.</p>
