  	<p>Jason Sheehan, writing for NPR&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Reading The Game&rdquo; series, which looks to cover &ldquo;some of the best, wildest, most moving or revealing stories&rdquo; in video games. To kick things off, Mr. Sheehan starts with No Man&rsquo;s Sky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the one side, there&rsquo;s the built-in story of the game, which is just <em>terrible</em>. At worst, it is incomprehensible spacey-spaceman gibberish about ancient civilizations and lost artifacts. And at it&rsquo;s best, it ain&rsquo;t much better — failing on many basic levels to tell a meta-story about the in-game universe being a simulation (which, you know, it is) where the player (also called &ldquo;the Traveler&rdquo;) is tasked by its creator to explore his way to the center of everything, essentially making the player a kind of galactic-level landlord checking in on all the tenants.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But on the other hand, it is also the best game I have ever experienced for self-generating storytelling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is going to be a great series.</p>
