  	<p>Researches Grant Storey, Dillon Reisman, Arvind Narayanan, and Jonathan Mayer, in a draft of an upcoming paper titled <a href="http://randomwalker.info/publications/ad-blocking-framework-techniques.pdf">&ldquo;The Future of Ad Blocking:
An Analytical Framework and New Techniques&rdquo; (PDF)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus we propose <em>perceptual ad blocking</em> which works radically differently from current ad blockers. It deliberately ignores useful
information in markup and limits itself to visually salient information, mimicking how a human user would recognize ads. We use lightweight computer vision techniques to implement such a tool and show that it defeats attempts to obfuscate the presence of ads.</p>

<p><a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/princetons-ad-blocking-superweapon-may-put-an-end-to-the-ad-blocking-arms-race">Jason Koebler</a>, <em>Vice</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission regulations require advertisements to be clearly labeled so that a human can recognize them, which has created a built-in advantage for consumers and, now, ad blockers. The team used several computer vision techniques to detect ads the same way that a human would, which they call &ldquo;perceptual ad blocking.&rdquo; Because advertisers must comply with these regulations, the authors imagine an &ldquo;end game&rdquo; in which consumers—and ad blockers—ultimately win.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because an ad is required to look like an ad, identification via computer vision or optical character recognition seems like a surefire way of blocking them indefinitely. A <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perceptual-ad-blocker/mahgiflleahghaapkboihnbhdplhnchp?hl=en0">proof of concept Chrome extension</a> is available, and it worked pretty well in my tests. The extension doesn&rsquo;t actually block ads, but overlays a watermark, proving its capability.</p>
<p>The ad-blocking arms race isn&rsquo;t going to last forever. There will be a winner, and it will be the users. This is unfortunate, because advertising isn&rsquo;t the problem; rather, the past decade of overly aggressive, intrusive data collecting, and resource hogging online ads have doomed this particular format. If publishers and advertisers aren&rsquo;t attempting to completely rethink how online ads work, they&rsquo;re either crazy or delusional.</p>
