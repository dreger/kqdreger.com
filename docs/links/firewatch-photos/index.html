<p>Over at Polygon, Ben Kuchera <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2016/2/8/10940370/firewatch-photos-hey-there-delilah">has how this feature came to be</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This was a good moment in the Panic/Campo relationship,&rdquo; Panic&rsquo;s Cabel Sasser told Polygon. [&hellip;] &ldquo;Steven, the other co-founder here at Panic, offhandedly says &lsquo;Man, what if you could print out your disposable camera photos somehow&rdquo;, and, well, here we are. When there’s an idea that immediately excites us both — like the idea behind <em>Firewatch</em> in the first place — it’s hard to stop us from doing it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only available for Windows, Mac, and Linux to start, but Sasser says they are &ldquo;investigating what it would take to make this happen on the PlayStation 4.&rdquo; Such a unique and fantastic feature.</p>
<p>Also, I think it says something about Panic&rsquo;s and Campo Santo&rsquo;s pride in the visuals of <em>Firewatch</em> that they not only encourage in-game photography, but also went and built a way for you to print your photos out.</p>
