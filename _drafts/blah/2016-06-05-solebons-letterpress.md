A couple of months ago, I noticed that Letterpress, the critically-acclaimed iOS word game, appeared to have [been sold][me] from Atebits to Solebon Inc. I reached out to Solebon for comment on the sale, and they replied with an email that I've been given permission to post. Here's some of the best bits: 

> Solebon acquired Letterpress from Atebits in December 2015. We had approached Loren Brichter in 2Q of 2015 but he wasn't interested in selling at that time. We revisited the topic with him in 4Q and agreed to move forward. 

> Loren remains involved as an advisor providing feedback on our development roadmap and related design and technical issues as requested.

> Going forward, we just released the 2.0 version of Letterpress which utilizes a new game server. Not only does this lay the groundwork for new features (like chat) but it enables expansion to other operating systems down the road. This update has been a bit bumpy due to a small bug impacting a few players and yesterday's big outage with many Apple services.
