John Gruber [tweeted](https://twitter.com/gruber/status/535298550213906434) that the new Apple typeface, San Francisco, may be unprintable, since the company only wants the font used in Apple Watch products. Indeed, printing from any text editor yields terrible results, but I found a way in the most unlikely of heroes: Google Chrome. 

Set your CSS `font-family` to "San Francisco Text," and then open up your site in Chrome. Click on File/Print, notice the non-standard printing dialogue, and then click on the "Open PDF in Preview" link. Bingo.

Trying the print-to-PDF in Safari doesn't work, arguably because it's using the OS X print dialogue. Chrome has a custom modal for their print screen, which must be able to bypass whatever security Apple bundled into San Francisco.

Here are the PDF's of both my [Safari](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eaqvt03g6e1zzyf/af-safari-sf.pdf?dl=0) and [Chrome](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hm9ywj5fxy4gffn/af-chrome-sf.pdf?dl=0) attempts.

As a side note: I really love the way San Francisco looks on the web. I'd love to see it as the default font across all Apple's devices, one day.
