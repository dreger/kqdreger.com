# The KD Manual of Style

This document serves as the living style guide for my writing, and I consider it a personalized list of rules that are a superset of those found in the New York Times Manual of Style. The goal of this document is to bring a consistent voice to all the writing on this site.

## Subheading

If you run a journalistic web column, please feel free to remix or copy the contents here for your own personal use. If you feel so obliged, a link back to this page is appreciated, but not required. This document will continue to evolve over time, so please check back occasionally.

### Ideology

If you do any sort of writing, particularly online, you should be using a style guide. Having some sort of reference for how _you_ write will help you make consistent editorial decisions, and it will help bring a level of polish to your work that many miss out on.

### Style & Tone

Brevity and clarity are paramount. Try to avoid didactic language. Write with purpose.

### Reference (A-Z)

- Apostrophes

> Following a word that ends in an 's,' "The Moss' house."

- Backup (noun)

> Appositive phrases should be chosen based on the context of your audience. Used to establish the context of a person, place, or thing without making the reader feel stupid. Ex. "Kyle Dreger, a writer and programmer from Ohio, created the AF Manual of Style, a resource he hopes is copied by bloggers everywhere." Don't be a jerk. Always make it clear who and where you're quoting from.
